As a middle school band director for over 10 years, I have relied on various tools for keeping things organized in my program.  These have included Excel Spreadsheets, MS Access Databases, Google Documents, etc.  These tools have worked, though have limitations in that they are not necessarily connected to each other, and are not always available.

My goal, called Project Bass at this point, is to build a web app designed to manage all of the aspects of a school music program.  The web app will track students, ensembles, lessons, attendance, schedules, music libraries, uniforms, and fundraising.

In the short term, I hope to have Project Bass up and running for myself and a few alpha tester director friends of mine by September of 2014.  Eventually, I would like to scale my project to a larger group of users, come up with a business plan, and market this project to music teachers.  Eventually, I would be building Android/iOS apps as well.

I am a novice web programmer, who is learning as I go.  Though I am a music teacher, my true passions lie in web development.  This project is a way for me to combine my career with my hobby.

I would appreciate feedback on this project, especially if you are someone like me who is both a music teacher, and a web programmer.
